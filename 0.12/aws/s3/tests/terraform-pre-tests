# Terraform's s3 resource doesn't let you use a variable in the lifecycle block
# for setting the prevent destroy option. You could potentially use condition tricks
# with counts, but then you have to duplicate resource blocks, and you have two
# different resource names which then forces you to change your outputs and what
# you look for in your tests. Just easier to provide a hook to swap the value so
# that we can automate destroying the s3 bucket when we're done.

sed -e 's/prevent_destroy = true/prevent_destroy = false/' s3-main.tf > tmp
mv tmp s3-main.tf
